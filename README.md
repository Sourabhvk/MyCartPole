# CartPole Reinforcement Learning Project

This project implements the CartPole environment for reinforcement learning experiments and training.

## Project Overview

We are working on the CartPole problem, a classic reinforcement learning benchmark where an agent learns to balance a pole on a cart by applying forces to move the cart left or right.

## Environment Requirements

### Python Version
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher

### Required Libraries

- **OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium**: 0.26.0 or higher
  - Provides the CartPole-v1 environment
  - Main RL environment framework

- **NumPy**: 1.21.0 or higher
  - Numerical computing library
  - Used for array operations and mathematical computations

- **Pandas**: 1.3.0 or higher
  - Data manipulation and analysis
  - Used for logging and analyzing training results

## Installation

```bash
pip install gymnasium numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Project Goals

- Implement various RL algorithms for CartPole
- Compare performance of different approaches
- Analyze learning curves and convergence
- Document best practices for RL training

## Getting Started

More details and implementation files will be added as the project develops.
