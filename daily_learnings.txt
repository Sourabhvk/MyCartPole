Daily Learnings - CartPole Project
===================================

Observations:
=============

CartPole Environment has 4 observation values (float32 array):

1. Cart Position
   - The horizontal position of the cart on the track
   - Continuous value representing where the cart is located

2. Cart Velocity
   - The speed and direction of the cart's movement
   - Positive values indicate rightward movement, negative values indicate leftward movement

3. Pole Angle
   - The angle of the pole relative to the vertical position
   - Measured in radians
   - Positive values indicate the pole is leaning to the right, negative values indicate leaning to the left

4. Pole Angular Velocity
   - The rate at which the pole's angle is changing
   - How fast the pole is rotating/falling

Space Types in Gymnasium:
========================

Box Space:
----------
In Gymnasium, a Box is a specific type of space used to represent data that is:

- Continuous: The values can be any real number within a given range (not just whole numbers). 
  Think of a dimmer switch, not an on/off switch.

- Multi-dimensional: It can represent:
  * A single number
  * A vector (like in CartPole's 4 values)
  * Even an image (a 2D or 3D array of pixels)

Action Space: Discrete(2):
-------------------------
This means your agent can choose from a discrete (countable) set of 2 actions.

Typically, these are 0 and 1:
- In CartPole: 
  * 0 means push left
  * 1 means push right

Key Takeaways:
=============
- Observation space is continuous (Box) with 4 dimensions
- Action space is discrete with 2 possible actions
- The agent must learn to balance the pole by choosing the right action based on the 4 observations
- This is a classic reinforcement learning problem where continuous state space meets discrete action space
